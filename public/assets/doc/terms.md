We reserve the right, at our own expense, to assume the exclusive defence and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by (without limiting your indemnification obligations with respect to that matter), and in that case, you agree to cooperate with our defence of those claims. We reserve the right to report any wrongdoing of which We become aware to the applicable government agencies or otherwise.

## 7. Disclaimer

THE SITE AND ALL MATERIALS AND CONTENT ON AND AVAILABLE THROUGH THE SITE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ON AN "AS AVAILABLE" BASIS. DAITA makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties, including without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights, and any warranty arising out of course of dealing, usage, or trade. DAITA does not warrant that the Site or any portion of the Site, or any materials or content offered through the Site, are accurate, complete, or current, or will be uninterrupted, secure, or free of errors, viruses, or other harmful components; and DAITA does not warrant that any of those issues will be corrected. DAITA may make changes to the Sites at any time without notice, including by limiting or discontinuing certain features of the Sites. DAITA does not, however, make any commitment to update the Sites. DAITA will have no liability for any change to the Site or any suspension or termination of your access to or use of the Site.

THE LIMITATIONS, EXCLUSIONS, AND DISCLAIMS IN THIS SECTION APPLY TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW. DAITA does not disclaim any warranty or other right that DAITA is prohibited from disclaiming under applicable law.

## 8. Limitations of Liability

TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL DAITA OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF DATA OR PROFIT, OR DUE TO BUSINESS INTERRUPTION,) ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SITE OR THE MATERIALS ON THE SITE, EVEN IF DAITA OR A DAITA AUTHORISED REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN NOTIFIED ORALLY OR IN WRITING OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF DAITA AND ITS SUPPLIERS TO YOU FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE ANY PORTION OF THE SITE OR OTHERWISE UNDER THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, IS LIMITED TO CHF 100. Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.
Each provision of these Terms and Conditions that provides for a limitation of liability, disclaimer of warranties, or exclusion of damages is intended to and does allocate the risks between the parties under these Terms and Conditions. This allocation is an essential element of the basis of the bargain between the parties. Each of these provisions is severable and independent of all other provisions of these Terms and Conditions. The limitations in this Section 8 will apply even if any limited remedy fails of its essential purpose.

## 9. Modifications

DAITA may revise these Terms and Conditions at any time without notice; provided that, if We make any material changes to these Terms and Conditions, We will use commercially reasonable efforts to notify you. By continuing to use the Site, you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these Terms and Conditions.

## 10. Governing Law

Any claim relating to the Sites or these Terms and Conditions will be governed by the laws of the Canton of Berne, Switzerland without regard to its conflict of law provisions.

## 11. Support

We are under no obligation to provide support for the Site. In instances where We may offer support, the support will be subject to published policies.
